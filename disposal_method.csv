"S. No.","Category of Drug/Dosage Form/Packaging","Handling Method","Method of Disposal","Remarks"
1,"Solids, Semisolids, Powders (Except Biological Waste)","To be removed from outer packaging but remain in inner packaging and placed in clean plastic or steel drums for treatment by encapsulation. Large quantities of loose tablets should be mixed with other medicines in different steel drums to avoid high concentrations of a single drug in any one drum.","Landfill,Waste encapsulation,Waste inertization,Medium and high-temperature incineration (cement kiln incinerator)","No more than 1% of daily municipal waste should be disposed of daily in an untreated form (non-immobilized) to a landfill."
2,"Liquids (Except Biological Waste)","Liquid vitamins, readily biodegradable organic material, may be diluted and flushed into sewer. Harmless solutions of salts, amino acids, lipids, or glucose may also be disposed of in sewers. If no sewers or functioning sewage treatment plant, dilute with large volumes of water and pour into large watercourses for immediate dispersion and dilution. Liquid pharmaceuticals, diluted or not, should not be discharged into slow-moving or stagnant surface waters.","Sewer,High-temperature incineration (cement kiln incinerator)","Antineoplastics not to be sent to sewer."
3,"Ampoules","Crush on a hard, impermeable surface (e.g., concrete) or in a metal drum/bucket using wood or hammer. Workers should wear protective equipment (eye protection, boots, clothing, gloves). Swept-up crushed glass should be placed in a sealed container suitable for sharp objects.","Crush ampoules and flush diluted fluid to sewer. Dispose of crushed glass in a landfill.","Antineoplastics not to be sent to sewer. Ampoules should not be burnt or incinerated as they may explode, causing injury or damage to incinerators. At temperatures above the glass melting point, they may clog incinerator grates."
4,"Aerosol Canisters","Depressurize in a controlled environment using appropriate equipment to release residual pressure safely. Segregate from other waste and store in rigid containers to prevent accidental puncture.","Landfill,Waste encapsulation","Not to be burnt: may explode."
5,"PVC Plastic, Glass","Clean to remove any residual drug contamination. Segregate from hazardous waste and place in designated containers for non-hazardous waste disposal or recycling.","Landfill","Not for burning in open containers."
6,"Paper, Cardboard","Remove any residual drug contamination and sort for recycling if clean. Segregate contaminated paper/cardboard for appropriate disposal.","Recycle,Burn,Landfill",""
7,"Anti-infective Drugs","Should be treated before disposal. Dilute in water, let stand for two weeks, then dispose to sewer.","Waste encapsulation,Waste inertization,Medium and high-temperature incineration (cement kiln incinerator)","Liquid antibiotics may be diluted with water, left for several weeks, and discharged to a sewer."
8,"Anti-neoplastics","Segregate from other pharmaceuticals, store in rigid-walled containers, clearly marked. Ideally, pack safely and return to supplier for disposal. Avoid crushing cartons or removing product from packages. Drums should be filled to 50% capacity with drugs, then add a well-stirred mixture of lime, cement, and water (15:15:5 by weight). Fill drums to capacity, seal by seam/spot welding, and let set for 7–28 days to form a solid block. Place in a landfill lined with an impermeable layer (clay or membrane).","Return to donor or manufacturer,Waste encapsulation,Waste inertization,High-temperature incineration","Not to landfill unless encapsulated. Not to sewer. No low or medium-temperature incineration."
9,"Controlled Drugs","Dispose of per Drugs & Cosmetics Act, 1940, Narcotic and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, and Bio-Medical Waste (Management and Handling) Rules, 2016, under intimation to concerned authorities. Expired stock of essential narcotic drugs to be destroyed as specified by the Controller of Drugs. Recognized medical institutions must destroy expired stock in the presence of an officer nominated by the Controller of Drugs. Unused essential narcotic drugs returned by patients are considered receipts by the institution.","Waste encapsulation,Waste inertization,Medium and high-temperature incineration (cement kiln incinerator)","Follow provisions of NDPS Rules, 1985. Not to landfill unless encapsulated."
10,"Disinfectants","Large volumes of disinfectants should not be flushed into sewers, as they can kill bacteria in sewage works and disrupt biological treatment. Large quantities should not be put into watercourses, as they can damage aquatic life. Small quantities of diluted disinfectants (up to 50 liters per day) may be disposed of by discharge to a sewer, spread over the whole working day.","Sewer or fast-flowing watercourse: small quantities of diluted disinfectants (maximum 50 liters per day under supervision)","No undiluted disinfectants to sewers or watercourses. Maximum 50 liters per day diluted to sewer or fast-flowing watercourse. No disinfectants to slow-moving or stagnant watercourses."
11,"Radioactive Drugs","Treat initially to change characteristics of radioactive waste to improve safety or economy. Liquid low-level waste (LLW) and intermediate-level waste (ILW) are typically solidified in cement, while high-level waste (HLW) is calcined/dried and vitrified in a glass matrix. Immobilized waste will be placed in a container suitable for its characteristics.","Deep geological disposal or as per AERB Guidelines",""
